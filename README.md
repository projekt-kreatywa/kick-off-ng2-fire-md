## what is this
kick-off-ng2-fire-md is an incarnation of kick-off-template-project. this time it is a template for a progressive web app built with [angular2](https://angular.io/) + [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) +

currently it contains following features:
 * social media login (facebook, twitter, google+ and github)
 * personal 'todo' item list
 * chat with other users
 
the project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.21 and is a clone of [angular2-firebase-material-demo](https://github.com/tarlepp/angular2-firebase-material-demo) by [tarleoo](https://github.com/tarlepp)

## installation
first of all you have to install ```npm``` and ```node.js``` to your box. installation instructions can
be found [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager). 

note that ```node.js 6.x``` is required.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/projekt-kreatywa/kick-off-ng2-fire-md.git
$ cd kick-off-ng2-fire-md

# install the project's dependencies with npm
$ npm install

# fast install (via yarn, https://yarnpkg.com)
$ yarn install  # or yarn
```
---

## firebase configuration
see `/src/app/config/config.ts_example` file and copy it to `/src/app/config/config.ts` file and make necessary changes to it. note that you need a [firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/) to get all necessary config values.

if you are not familiar with firebase and/or don't have a firebase developer account, sign up quickly with your google id here: [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/).

after you have created new application you will need to make some [security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/quickstart) 
for the used data storage. below is configuration that this demo application uses, so you can use the same within your 
application.

```
{
    "rules": {
      "messages": {
          ".write": "auth !== null",
          ".read": "auth !== null"
      },
      "todos": {
        "$uid": {
          // grants write access to the owner of this user account whose uid must exactly match the key ($uid)
          ".write": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid",
          // grants read access to any user who is logged in with facebook
          ".read": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid"
        }
      }
    }
}
```

these rules ensure that 'todo' items are show only to user who made those. also chat messages requires that user is
logged in to read / write those.

## development with angular-cli
to start developing in the project run:

```bash
$ npm start
# or
$ ng serve
```

then head to `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

### code scaffolding
run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. you can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

### build
run `ng build` to build the project. the build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### tests

#### unit tests

```bash
$ npm test
# or
$ ng test
```

#### e2e tests

```bash
$ npm run e2e
# or

```

### deploying to github pages

run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to github pages.
